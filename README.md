### Hi there 👋

I'm a research engineer at the National University of Singapore (NUS), embarking on a dynamic journey that merges technology with imagination. My passion lies at the intersection of AI and robotics, where I'm on a mission to unveil the boundless possibilities they offer.

🔍 My current research interest lies in robotic learning, where I am exploring innovative methods to improve the learning and adaptability of robotic systems in dynamic environments.

🤝 I extend an invitation to you – fellow enthusiasts and curious minds – to join me on this voyage. Let's explore, discuss, and collaborate as we dive deep into the uncharted waters of AI, robotics, and the transformative potential they hold.

Feel free to connect with me and check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/H-tr).
